## Switching to this fork for updates!

This is a fork of CoinCashew's excellent staking tool at https://github.com/coincashew/ethpillar.  
We haven't heard from CoinCashew for a while, so this is a place where fixes and updates can be made.

To get the updates from this repo you'll need to do the following only once:

After installing EthPillar normally (see below) or if you have an existing install, run these two commands:

```bash
cd ~/git/ethpillar
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mjkeating/EthPillar.git
```

After this, from EthPillar you can run **System Administration → Update EthPillar** and it will update from this repo.

Hopefully, we'll see CoinCashew return soon!

**Note:** This fork is now at version **5.2.7** - it includes fixes for Nethermind and MEV-Boost updating. Also, improved versions display.
